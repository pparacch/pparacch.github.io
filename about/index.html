	<p>I’m Pier Lorenzo Paracchini, <b>"generalist"</b> with a passion for <b>people</b>, <b>data</b> and <b>technology</b>.</p>

	<p>I am Italian and, currently, living in Stavanger (Norway). I have a Master of Science in Electronic Engineering from the <a href="http://www.polimi.it/en/english-version/", target="_blank">“Politecnico Di Milano”</a>, a valuable experience in Software Engineering and, at the moment, working as an enthusiast developer with a <i>data scientist twist</i> in the <b>Software Innovation</b> sector in Statoil.</p>

	<p>I am intrigued by data science and machine learning. My journey into data science and machine learning has started in 2014, when for curiosity I started the first module of the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science", target="_blank">"Data Science Specialization"</a> at Coursera. Since then I have been <b>hooked with data science and machine learning</b>.</p>

	<p>I have learnt a lot of things, and still, have many exciting and interesting things to learn and master. In this blog I will capture the interesting experiences, learning I have found and I will find on my journey.</p>
