I have thought for a long time to set up a site describing my professional journey, my passions for people/ data and technology and, __finally__, I have stopped procastinating and moved into action.

I wanted to have something simple and powerful at the same time so I ended up choosing [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

The recipe:

* [tutorial](https://pages.github.com/) on how to set up a website in github
* a great [tutorial](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) on how to create content using [Jekyll and Github pages](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/).

I can now use Markdown to author my posts. Surprisingly It was a lot more easier than I thought.

Next steps:

* finalize the website structure
* set up Jekyll & Github Pages to work locally before pushing into Github
