title: Setting up my web site in Github
---
I have thought for a long time to set up a site describing my professional journey, my passions for people/ data and technology and, __finally__, I have stopped procastinating and moved into action.

I wanted to have something simple and powerful at the same time so I ended up choosing [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

The recipe:

* [tutorial](https://pages.github.com/) on how to set up a website in github
* a great [tutorial](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) on how to create content using [Jekyll and Github pages](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/).

I can now use Markdown to author my posts. Surprisingly It was a lot more easier than I thought.

In order to make it easy to create web pages I would highly recommend to install Jekyll locally on the machine. I have had few issues when Github was building the website with meaningless error messages. Having Jekyll locally installed it is possible to launch the website locally and debugging the issues.

For the installation of Jekyll on my local machine (mac OS) I have followed the [Jekyll documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/).

Next steps:

* finalize the website structure
* spend some more time understanding Jekyll
