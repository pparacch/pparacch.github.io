Maintaining R on a Windows based computer is not a simple and straightforward task. When a new version of R is published you should download the new version and install locally on the machine, you then should reinstall all of the needed packages for the new version of R. If you are using RStudio, you need to remember to set properly the version you want to use, especially when having multiple versions installed on the same machine.
