>"Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the software is improved to pass the new tests, only. This is opposed to software development that allows software to be added that is not proven to meet requirements.", from [TDD - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)

This is an __hands-on exercise__ on using __TDD with R__ to solve a simple problem: implement a roman number conversion algorithm. The main focus is on the practice of Test Driven Development and not the code/ algorithm created.

The outcome of this practice can be found in this [repository](https://github.com/pparacch/tdd_r_with_testthat). The following artifacts have been created

- `tests/test_input_argument_validity.R`, the current tests used for validity of input argument.  
- `tests/test_roman_numeral_conversiona.R`, the current tests used for converstions.  
- `code/roman_numeral.R`, the code used for the conversion.  

In order to be able to run the example the following packages need to be locally installed

- the `checkpoint` package used for reproducibility,
- the `testthat` package used for unit testing.

```r
#Using the CRAN repo
install.packages("checkpoint")
install.packages("testthat")
```

More information on how the `testthat` package can be found in the following blog ["TDD and unit testing in R using the 'testthat' package"](https://pparacch.github.io/2017/05/18/test_driven_development_in_r.html)

## Assumption

* Be sure that the working directory is set to the parent directory of `code` and `tests` folders.
* Run the set up file using `source("set_up_env.R")`
    * run `checkpoint("2017-09-15")` to be sure to have the correct version of the packages
    * set the folders used for the _code_ and _tests_ and switched on the __Autotest__ modality using the `auto_test()` function
    * all of the unit tests are run and __every change to code or tests (from now on) will trigger the running of all tests__

## TDD approach: step by step

### Starting Up

__Think about the design of the code__, in this case the function that we want to develop  

* where to put the function, e.g folder, file
* name of the function
* function parameter(s)
    * what type of parameter(s)
    * any assumption(s) on the possible values

__Implement the shell of the function__ , with a very simplicistic implementation

* it accept an argument (any type)
* it returns a "I" value (hardcoded simplification)


```r
convert_to_roman <- function(num){
  return("I")
}
```

__The TDD mindset__, before writing any code

* write a failing test, and then
* make the simplest change to the code in order to make it pass (cut & paste allowed)
* re-run all tests, and when all tests are passing
* refactor the existing code using the tests as a safety net
* repeat for a new test condition


### Applied Incremental Design, one small step at a time

#### Step1, the argument must be integer otherwise an exception is thrown

(1) Create a test passing as argument a non numeric/ integer (e.g. 1) - expecting an error

* Add expectation: pass 1 return an error
    * Will fail cause an error is not thrown

```r
#Add expectation
context("Input Argument Validity")

test_that("passing a non numeric/ integer an exception is thrown",{
  expect_error(object = convert_to_roman(1))
})
}
```

* Modify the code in order to make it pass

```r
#Modify the code
convert_to_roman <- function(num){
  if(!is.integer(num)) stop("must be integer")
  return("I")
}
```

* Add expectation: pass 3.14 return an error
    * Will pass (same condition as before just a different argument)

```r
#Add expectations
context("Input Argument Validity")

test_that("passing a non numeric/ integer an exception is thrown",{
  expect_error(object = convert_to_roman(1))
  expect_error(object = convert_to_roman(3.14))
})
```

* Add expectation: pass a string return an error
    * Will pass (same condition as before just a different type for argument)

```r
#Add expectations
context("Input Argument Validity")

test_that("passing a non numeric/ integer an exception is thrown",{
  expect_error(object = convert_to_roman(1))
  expect_error(object = convert_to_roman(3.14))
  expect_error(object = convert_to_roman("test"))
})
```

(2) Create a test passing as argument a numeric/ integer (e.g. 1L) - expecting roman numeral "I"

* Add expectation: pass 1L return "I"
    * Will pass ("I" is hradcoded)

```r
context("Input Argument Validity")

test_that("passing a non numeric/ integer an exception is thrown",{
  expect_error(object = convert_to_roman(1))
  expect_error(object = convert_to_roman(3.14))
  expect_error(object = convert_to_roman("test"))
})

test_that("passing a numeric/ integer no exception thrown",{
  expect_match(object = convert_to_roman(1L), regexp = "^I$")
})
```

#### Step2, passing an integer the correct roman numeral is returned

(3) Create a test passing as argument an integer between [1..3]

* Add expectation: pass 1L return "I"
    * Should pass cause already coverend in (2)

```r
#Create a new context, a new test and add expectation
context("Roman Numeral Conversion")

test_that("passing an integer between [1..3] the correct roman numeral is returned",{
  expect_match(object = convert_to_roman(1L), regexp = "^I$")
})
```

* Add expectation: pass 2L return "II"
    * Will fail cause wrong roman numeral is returned

```r
#Create a new context, a new test and add expectation
context("Roman Numeral Conversion")

test_that("passing an integer between [1..3] the correct roman numeral is returned",{
  expect_match(object = convert_to_roman(1L), regexp = "^I$")
  expect_match(object = convert_to_roman(2L), regexp = "^II$")
})
```

* Modify the code in order to make it pass

```r
#Modify the code
convert_to_roman <- function(num){
  if(!is.integer(num)) stop("must be integer")
  if (num == 1L) return("I")
  if (num == 2L) return("II")
}
```

Repeat for 3 return "III": add expectation (make the test fail) and modify the code (make the test pass)

```r
#Create a new context, a new test and add expectation
context("Roman Numeral Conversion")

test_that("passing an integer between [1..3] the correct roman numeral is returned",{
  expect_match(object = convert_to_roman(1L), regexp = "^I$")
  expect_match(object = convert_to_roman(2L), regexp = "^II$")
  expect_match(object = convert_to_roman(3L), regexp = "^III$")
})
```

```r
#Modify the code
convert_to_roman <- function(num){
  if(!is.integer(num)) stop("must be integer")
  if (num == 1L) return("I")
  if (num == 2L) return("II")
  if (num == 3L) return("III")
}
```

(4) Create a test passing as argument a particular integer 4

* Add expectation: pass 4L return "IV"
    * Will fail cause wrong roman numeral is returned

```r
#Add a new test and add expectation
context("Roman Numeral Conversion")

test_that("passing an integer between [1..3] the correct roman numeral is returned",{
  expect_match(object = convert_to_roman(1L), regexp = "^I$")
  expect_match(object = convert_to_roman(2L), regexp = "^II$")
  expect_match(object = convert_to_roman(3L), regexp = "^III$")
})

test_that("passing an integer 4 the correct roman numeral is returned",{
  expect_match(object = convert_to_roman(4L), regexp = "^IV$")
})
```

* Modify the code in order to make it pass

```r
#Modify the code
convert_to_roman <- function(num){
  if(!is.integer(num)) stop("must be integer")
  if (num == 1L) return("I")
  if (num == 2L) return("II")
  if (num == 3L) return("III")
  if (num == 4L) return("IV")
}
```

(5) Create a test passing as argument a particular integer 5

* Add expectation: pass 5L return "V"
    * Will fail cause wrong roman numeral is returned
* Modify the code in order to make it pass

Continue one simple step at a time .....

Note that the code implementing that function is shaped incrementally, one smal step after the other. Using this simple approach the final tests and code will look like

```r
#Test for the conversion [1..10]
context("Roman Numeral Conversion")

test_that("passing an integer between [1..3] the correct roman numeral is returned",{
  expect_match(object = convert_to_roman(1L), regexp = "^I$")
  expect_match(object = convert_to_roman(2L), regexp = "^II$")
  expect_match(object = convert_to_roman(3L), regexp = "^III$")
})

test_that("passing an integer 4 the correct roman numeral is returned",{
  expect_match(object = convert_to_roman(4L), regexp = "^IV$")
})

test_that("passing an integer 5 the correct roman numeral is returned",{
  expect_match(object = convert_to_roman(5L), regexp = "^V$")
})

test_that("passing an integer between [6..8] the correct roman numeral is returned",{
  expect_match(object = convert_to_roman(6L), regexp = "^VI$")
  expect_match(object = convert_to_roman(7L), regexp = "^VII$")
  expect_match(object = convert_to_roman(8L), regexp = "^VIII$")
})

test_that("passing an integer 9 the correct roman numeral is returned",{
  expect_match(object = convert_to_roman(9L), regexp = "^IX$")
})

test_that("passing an integer 10 the correct roman numeral is returned",{
  expect_match(object = convert_to_roman(10L), regexp = "^X$")
})
```

```r
#Simplest code possible to pass the tests
convert_to_roman <- function(num){
  if(!is.integer(num)) stop("must be integer")

  if(num == 1L) return("I")
  if(num == 2L) return("II")
  if(num == 3L) return("III")
  if(num == 4L) return("IV")
  if(num == 5L) return("V")
  if(num == 6L) return("VI")
  if(num == 7L) return("VII")
  if(num == 8L) return("VIII")
  if(num == 9L) return("IX")
  if(num == 10L) return("X")
}
```

Once we have a test harness around the code we can __start to refactor the code__ in order to get a more general and flexible solution

* change the code/ refactor
* run all tests and make them pass
* repeat till you are satisfied

```r
convert_to_roman <- function(num){
  if(!is.integer(num)) stop("must be integer")

  roman_numeral <- NULL
  decimal_values <- c(10L, 9L, 5L,4L, 1L)
  roman_numerals <- c("X", "IX", "V","IV", "I")

  for (i in 1: length(decimal_values)){
    while(decimal_values[i] <= num){
      roman_numeral <- paste(roman_numeral, roman_numerals[i], sep = "")
      num <- num - decimal_values[i]
    }
  }
  return(roman_numeral)
}
```
