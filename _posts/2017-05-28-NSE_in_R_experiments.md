title: "Non-standard Evaluation in R: an exploration"
description: "Understanding basic concepts behind NSE in R based on material present in 'Advanced R' by Hadley Wickham #R #NSE #SE #softwaredevelopment #coding"
---

Understanding how non-standard evaluation (NSE) work is key when moving from an interactively approach through the R console to __developing reusable code in R__ e.g. via scripts and R packages .  

I would like to share some __notes__/ __experiments__ collected in order to build a better understanding around this interesting topic. The content is based/ inspired on the __["Non-standard Evaluation"](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Computing-on-the-language.html) chapter__ in [__"Advanced R"__](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/) by __Hadley Wickham__.

__[Here](http://rpubs.com/pparacch/280365)__ is possible to find the main learnings published in __[RPubs](http://rpubs.com/pparacch/)__. The __supporting R markdown__ used to generate the document can be found __[here](https://github.com/pparacch/DataSciencePosts/blob/master/nse_vs_se_in_r_exploration.Rmd)__.


Enjoy the learnings & Have fun with R...
