I would like to share a "playground" example that I have been using to build up my knowledge and understanding of the KNN algorithm and its application. The exercise is __inspired__ from from the example discussed in _"Chapter 3. K-Nearest Neighbors"_ of __["Thoughtful Machine Learning with Python"](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920039082.do) by Matthew Kirk__, the application of the algorithm to a regression problem: __the prediction of value of houses in the Seattle area__.

[Here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pparacch/DataSciencePosts/blob/master/KNN/KNN-overview.ipynb) is possible to find the notebook describing the __application of the KNN algorithm__ to this specific problem. The supporting code & data can be found [here](https://github.com/pparacch/DataSciencePosts/tree/master/KNN).

The example has been implemented using Jupyter Notebook and the Python ecosystem. The 'SciPy' module has been used for the KNN/ KDTree implementation.

Enjoy the learnings...
