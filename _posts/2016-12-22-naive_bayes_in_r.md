[Here](http://rpubs.com/pparacch/237109) is possible to find the __application of the Naive Bayes approach__ to a specific problem: the classification of SMS into __spam__ ("an undesired messages, e.g. advertising") or __ham__ ("a desired message containing valuable information that is not considered spam‚Äù). The supporting code can be found [here](https://github.com/pparacch/DataSciencePosts/blob/master/exp_NLP_NaiveBayes_example.Rmd).

The data used for such playground activity is the [SMS Spam Collection v. 1](http://www.dt.fee.unicamp.br/~tiago/smsspamcollection/), a public set of SMS messages that have been collected for mobile phone spam research where each message has been properly labeled as __spam__ or __ham__.

### Background information

__Q:__ What is classification?

_'In machine learning and statistics, classification is the problem of identifying to which of a set of categories (sub-populations) a new observation belongs, on the basis of a training set of data containing observations (or instances) whose category membership is known. An example would be assigning a given email into "spam" or "non-spam" classes or assigning a diagnosis to a given patient as described by observed characteristics of the patient (gender, blood pressure, presence or absence of certain symptoms, etc.). Classification is an example of pattern recognition.'_ [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification)

Classification is a type of __supervised learning__ problem.

__Q__: What is supervised learning?

_'Supervised learning is the machine learning task of inferring a function from labeled training data.[1] The training data consist of a set of training examples. In supervised learning, each example is a pair consisting of an input object (typically a vector) and a desired output value (also called the supervisory signal). A supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function, which can be used for mapping new examples.'_ [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning)

__Q__: What is a Naive Bayes classifier?

_'Naive Bayes classifiers are a family of simple probabilistic classifiers based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features.'_ [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier)

To have a better overview and understanding of the theory behind text classification & Naive Bayes classifiers, the material created by __Dan Jurafsky & Christopher Manning__ for the __"Natural Language Processing" MOOC__ at __Coursera__ is a great starting point
