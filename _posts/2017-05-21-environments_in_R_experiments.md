title: "Environments in R: an exploration"
description: "Understanding basic concepts around environments in R based on material present in 'Advanced R' by Hadley Wickham #R #environmentsinR #softwaredevelopment #coding"

Understanding how environments work is key when __developing code in R__, especially when trying to find out undesired behaviors (__debugging__) and/ or __creating R packages__.  

I would like to share some __notes__/ __experiments__ collected in order to build a better understanding around this interesting topic. The content is based/ inspired on the __["Environments"](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Environments.html) chapter__ in [__"Advanced R"__](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/) by __Hadley Wickham__.

__[Here](http://rpubs.com/pparacch/278710)__ is possible to find the main learnings published in __[RPubs](http://rpubs.com/pparacch/)__. The __supporting R markdown__ used to generate the document can be found __[here](https://github.com/pparacch/DataSciencePosts/blob/master/environments_exploration.Rmd)__.


Enjoy the learnings & Have fun with R...
