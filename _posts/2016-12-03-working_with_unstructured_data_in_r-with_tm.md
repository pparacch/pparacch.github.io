title: "NLP: Working with Unstructured Data with the `tm` package"
---
In the last weeks I have spent some time __experimenting and playing around with the `tm` package__, some __learnings and examples on how to use it__ can be found [here][5]. It is a great package to perform __text mining__ and __transform free text__ into __features__ that can be used for further data analysis.  

#### Background Information

[Text Mining][1] is the process of finding useful insights/ information from text and transform it, using NLP (Natural Language Processing) and analytical methods, into data that could be used for further analysis.

There are many [packages][2] that could be used for Natural Language Processing but only one package is the cornerstone of NLP in R, __the `tm` package__.

  _`'In recent years, we have elaborated a framework to be used in packages dealing with the processing of written material: the package tm. Extension packages in this area are highly recommended to interface with tm's basic routines...'` (from CRAN website)_

The `tm` package provides a comprehensive text mining framework for R. More information about it can be found in ["Text Minining Infrastructure in R"][3] publication (Journal of Statistical Software) and the ["Introduction of the tm Package"][4] vignette.
