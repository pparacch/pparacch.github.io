	<p>At the beginning of my journey, I was mainly concern on <b>continously learning new stuff</b> following MOOCs one after another, <b>without spending enough time to "digest" all the learning and using it on real problems</b>. It was not a wise approacch and, after a while, I have started to realize that it is actually not enough.</p>

	<p>The best way to <b>really master a topic</b> is to <b>practice continuously</b> and <b>be hands-on</b>. In other words, <b>get your hands dirty</b> working on some <b>pet projects</b>, <b>replicating experiments</b>, or even better, <b>capstone projects</b> and <b>Kaggle</b> competitions.</p>
